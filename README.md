# Deeplab on a custom Dataset

This repository contains the official deeplab model implemented in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

Some small changes are made to use it for a custom Dataset.

Used together with [masksToDiameterService](https://github.com/Johannes0Horn/masksToDiameterService"Example") one can predict the diameter of a trunk from a photo of the trunk and a regular credit card.

## Example and Visualization:
